# **Project Title:** Onboarding with MS Forms, Automate, and Azure  

## **Project Description**  
This project automates the user onboarding process using Microsoft Forms, Power Automate, and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It enhances identity and access management (IAM) by streamlining user provisioning, role assignments, and governance while addressing HR system limitations and enforcing security best practices.  

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Automated User Onboarding**  
- Uses Microsoft Forms for structured user data collection.  
- Power Automate workflows handle form submissions and create user accounts in Azure AD.  
- Ensures a seamless and scalable onboarding process.  

### **2. Dynamic Group Assignments**  
- Configures Azure AD Dynamic Groups with attribute-based access control (ABAC).  
- Automatically assigns users to groups based on department or role.  
- Reduces manual group management efforts and ensures consistency.  

### **3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Azure AD PIM**  
- Integrates Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for secure, role-based access.  
- Enables temporary or just-in-time access for privileged roles.  
- Provides a cost-effective approach to managing elevated permissions securely.  

### **4. Identity Governance & Compliance**  
- Utilizes Azure P2 License features for access provisioning automation.  
- Implements best practices to prevent premature account activation.  
- Enhances security by ensuring proper credential management.  

### **5. Enterprise-Grade IAM Simulation**  
- Simulates real-world IAM workflows used in enterprises.  
- Automates the user lifecycle process while addressing HR system constraints.  
- Demonstrates hands-on experience in IAM best practices and security principles.  

## **Technical Specifications**  

- **Programming Language(s):** No-code/low-code implementation using Power Automate and Azure Logic Apps.  
- **Framework(s):** Microsoft Power Platform, Azure Active Directory.  
- **Database:** Azure AD as the identity store; optional integration with HR databases.  
- **Deployment Environment:** Cloud-based deployment on Microsoft Azure.  

## **Development Roadmap**  

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup and Automation**  
- **Milestone 1:** Configure Microsoft Forms to collect essential user data.  
- **Milestone 2:** Develop Power Automate workflows to process form submissions and create user accounts in Azure AD.  

### **Phase 2: Access Management and Governance**  
- **Milestone 3:** Implement Azure AD Dynamic Groups with ABAC for automated group assignments.  
- **Milestone 4:** Integrate Azure AD PIM for role-based access control and automate governance policies.  

## **Important Considerations**  

### **Key Challenges & Potential Roadblocks:**  
- **HR System Limitations:** Some HR systems may not provide real-time updates, which could delay onboarding automation.  
- **Data Accuracy & Validation:** Ensuring user-provided data in Microsoft Forms is accurate to prevent provisioning errors.  
- **Licensing Constraints:** The project depends on Azure AD P2 Licenses, which may impact cost considerations.  
- **Security & Compliance Risks:** Preventing unauthorized access and ensuring strict IAM governance policies are followed.  
- **Workflow Failures & Debugging:** Handling errors in Power Automate workflows and ensuring reliability in automated processes.  

### **Important Design Decisions to Consider:**  
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) vs. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Choosing the right access model for group assignments and permissions.  
- **User Identity Verification:** Ensuring secure authentication before account creation to prevent fraudulent access.  
- **Scalability & Future Expansion:** Designing workflows that can scale with organizational growth and changing IAM requirements.  
- **Automated Deprovisioning:** Implementing workflows for user offboarding to remove access when employees leave the organization.  

This project provides a structured, automated, and secure onboarding solution using Microsoft cloud technologies, ensuring efficient identity lifecycle management while addressing potential challenges and security concerns.
